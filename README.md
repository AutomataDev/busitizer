# Busitizer

From the about page:

    THE BUSITIZER applies star of stage and screen Gary Busey to your very own Facebook photos.
    Connect your Facebook profile and let THE BUSITIZER discover which of your memories best deserves a little more Gary Busey.

Basically, this app connects to Facebook, grabs some pictures, and pastes Gary Busey on the faces that it finds.

There's also a twitter bot component (the original inspiration of busitizer), allowing people to tweet links at the bot, but it can then busitize.

*Development setup*

    > git clone git@github.com:csinchok/busitizer.git
    > cd busitizer
    > vagrant up

That should be it!
